This is a JavaScript project that creates an interactive and visually appealing virtual aquarium. It simulates the behavior of various aquatic elements, such as fish, seaweeds, rocks, and bubbles. This project aims to provide an enjoyable and immersive experience for users.

Features
Use subdivision techniques to draw at least 3 different types of tropical fish with separate components like the head, body, and colorful patterns.
Animate the fish tails to create realistic swimming movements.
Implement swarming behavior for 3 schools of fish, each consisting of 8 to 12 fish, displaying periodic cohesion, scattering, and other flocking behaviors.
Vary the size of each fish to create visual depth and obstruction effects when fish overlap.
Include 10 to 15 individual fish that wander around the aquarium independently.
Use Bezier curves to animate seaweeds, creating a swaying motion.
Create a particle system to generate periodic bubbles from selected rocks, with bubbles starting fast and slowing down while increasing in size.
