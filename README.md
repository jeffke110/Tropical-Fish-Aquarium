# Tropical-Fish-Aquarium

This project includes a 1500x400 canvas. I was not able to implement the scrolling mechanics to the canvas.
There are 3 schools of fish that include cohesion, flocking mechanics with 8 - 12 fish.
There are 3 types of fish that swim through the aquarium with different sizes.
The tail is animated using a bezier
Rocks every other second release bubbles every other second using particle mechanics.
Also, there are seaweeds that use the bezier function.
